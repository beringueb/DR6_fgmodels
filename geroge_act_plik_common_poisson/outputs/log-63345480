[prior] *WARNING* External prior 'tau_planck_prior' loaded. Mind that it might not be normalized!
[prior] *WARNING* External prior 'calibration_SPT' loaded. Mind that it might not be normalized!
[tensorflow] *WARNING* Please fix your imports. Module tensorflow.python.training.tracking.data_structures has been moved to tensorflow.python.trackable.data_structures. The old module will be deleted in version 2.11.
[soliket.cosmopower] Loaded CosmoPower from directory ../data/lcdm/TTTEEE/
[soliket.cosmopower] CosmoPower will expect the parameters {'ln10^{10}A_s', 'omega_b', 'n_s', 'tau_reio', 'omega_cdm', 'H0'}
[soliket.cosmopowerderived] Loaded CosmoPowerDerived from directory ../data/lcdm/derived-parameters/
[soliket.cosmopowerderived] CosmoPowerDerived will expect the parameters {'ln10^{10}A_s', 'omega_b', 'n_s', 'tau_reio', 'omega_cdm', 'H0'}
[soliket.cosmopowerderived] CosmoPowerDerived can provide the following parameters:                                                             {'thetas100', 'YHe', 'zrend', 'taustar', 'rarend', 'taurend', 'rastar', 'rrend', 'zdrag', 'zrei', 'zstar', 'rstar', 'sigma8', 'Neff'}.
[mflike.mflike] Number of bins used: 798
[mflike.mflike] Will be including the following fg components for highL likelihood: 
tt : ksz, cibp, radio, galactic_spt, tsz_and_cib, 

[mflike.mflike] Initialized!
[prior] *WARNING* There are unbounded parameters (['a_gtt_as', 'a_gtt_ae', 'a_gtt_spt_95', 'a_gtt_spt_150', 'a_gtt_spt_220', 'a_r_a', 'cal_acts_148', 'cal_acte_148']). Prior bounds are given at 0.9999995 confidence level. Beware of likelihood modes at the edge of the prior
[mcmc] Getting initial point... (this may take a few seconds)
[prior] Reference values or pdfs for some parameters were not provided. Sampling from the prior instead for those parameters.
[model] Measuring speeds... (this may take a few seconds)
[model] Setting measured speeds (per sec): {mflike.MFLike: 21.4, soliket.CosmoPower: 17.4, soliket.CosmoPowerDerived: 696.0}
[mcmc] Initial point: H0:67.66, logA:3.047, ns:0.9665, ombh2:0.02242, omch2:0.11933, tau:0.0561, a_tSZ:4.8, a_kSZ:2.1, a_CIB:47, xi:0.4, beta_c:2.87, a_gtt_as:0.4, a_gtt_ae:0.8, a_gtt_spt_95:0.1684113, a_gtt_spt_150:0.1582392, a_gtt_spt_220:1.486548, a_r_a:2.9, a_r_s:0.9561724, a_CIBp:47, cal_acts_148:1, cal_acts_220:1.01, cal_acte_148:1, cal_acte_220:0.99, cal_sptr_90:0.9958888, cal_sptr_150:0.9262008, cal_sptr_220:0.9661598
[prior] *WARNING* Reference pdf not defined or improper for some parameters. Using prior's sigma instead for them.
[mcmc] Covariance matrix not present. We will start learning the covariance of the proposal earlier: R-1 = 30 (would be 2 if all params loaded).
[mcmc] Sampling!
